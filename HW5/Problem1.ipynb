        "* In this project you will develop an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to generate text.\n",
        "* By training the model on various works, you will try to produce coherent and stylistically relevant text based on seed phrases (prompts).\n",
        "* To improve the model's performance, you will explore the use of multiple training data, additional LSTM layers, and other optimizations.\n",
        "* The quantity and quality of training data are crucial for achieving meaningful text generation; a larger and more diverse dataset allows the model to better capture the nuances and patterns of written text.\n",
        "* I will be creating 2 different LSTM models and using them to generate text based on 5 different Shakespeare stories."

        "The thing that is really interesting about the 3-layer model is that it basically only uses the most common words whereas the single layer model used very obsure words and often avoided the most common ones. All of the epochs tend to use 'i, you, thou' quite frequently. None of these are coherent either. I am unsure why this one and the previous one are so different with word choices.This one is hard to read as there is a lot of repetition of consecutive pronouns. Varying the number of units in each LSTM layer creates a hierarchical learning structure for the model. I think I may have started too small and created a bottleneck issue. That could be why mainly the simplest words were always used. Smaller units are faster and won't overfit, but won't generate as high quality text. For a larger dataset like this one, I should have gone with higher numbers."

        "> I was honestly disappointed when reading the text that was generated after spending quite some time working on this assignment over the past week. When I originally generated text, I ran into the issue of punctuation being repeated like normal words. In Shakespeare, there are a lot of apostrophes and dashes and colons. The line breaks are also different because most of the texts I used were plays and there would be a character name, a colon, and a sentence. After trying to deal with them, I couldn't really find a good solution, so I removed punctuation altogether. After attempt 1, everything looked good. Then, I got to the text generation and \"overthrow\" was being repeated like 10-20 times in a row on each prompt. So I went back to the drawing board and focused lots of time on the TextGenerator. Some edits got me closer and some pushed me farther away from a good solution. After hours of trying to fix this, I reverted to the one that gave the best results for the first LSTM. I am thankful that I was able to stay connected to my runtime for the entire time I was testing and debugging. The second LSTM model took around an hour to run and might honestly be worse than the first model that took 20 mins to run. Unfortunately, there was a big disconnect between the 2 models and each was missing something the other had. As much as I would love to spend 15 hours fixing my models and training them again, I unfortunately cannot and had to settle with what I generated here."
